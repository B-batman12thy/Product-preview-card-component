## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries for the responsive

### What I learned

i learn a lot in this first challenge about the responsive card
first of all grid layout
```
body{
  display:grid;
}
```
And i learn how to reset all your css code with josh comeau(https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
```
```

the variable in css 
i learn how to declare variable in css and how i can use same variable in two different classes 
```
--clr-white:white;
.card{
  color:--clr-white;
}
content{
  color:--clr-white;
}
 ``` 
 it's very useful because we can use the same variable in all of css class. it will be also very helpful when you are using figma template.

 ### Continued development
 SO yeah wanna Continue to learn the flexbox and the grid even if they both are the same but they have different approche.
### Useful resources
